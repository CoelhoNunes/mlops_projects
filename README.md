# MLOps Portfolio Project

Welcome to this **MLOps Portfolio Project**—an evolving exploration of the full lifecycle of machine learning systems.

##  Project Overview

This repository serves as a hands-on journey through MLOps principles: from experimentation and model development to deployment, automation, and monitoring—all aimed at building robust, production-ready ML solutions.

## What You're Exploring

You'll be covering and implementing:

- **Core MLOps Concepts**: Understand how ML development integrates with DevOps practices—CI/CD pipelines, reproducibility, versioning of data, code, models, and more :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

- **Toolchain Immersion**: Work with industry-standard tools such as:
  - MLflow (experiment tracking & model registry)
  - ZenML or equivalent frameworks
  - Containerization tools like Docker
  - CI/CD automation (e.g., using GitHub Actions) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **End-to-End Pipeline Construction**: Build workflows—from data ingestion and preprocessing, through model training and evaluations, to deployment and live monitoring :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

- **Deployment & User Interface Design**: Create deployable ML services (e.g., via Streamlit or FastAPI) to make your models accessible and interactive :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
