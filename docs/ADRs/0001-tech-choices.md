# ADR-0001: Technology Stack and Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to build a production-ready MLOps project that demonstrates enterprise-level skills while maintaining simplicity and avoiding vendor lock-in. The project must be pragmatic, readable, and heavily documented, with a focus on MLflow as the central experiment tracking and model registry system.

## Decision

We will use **MLflow exclusively** for experiment tracking and model registry, avoiding other tracking tools like Weights & Biases, Neptune, DVC, ZenML, Airflow, Prefect, Argo, or Hydra.

## Rationale

### Why MLflow Only?

1. **Open Source & Vendor Neutral**: MLflow is open-source and doesn't lock us into proprietary cloud services
2. **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted in production ML environments
3. **Self-Hosted**: Can run locally or on-premises without external dependencies
4. **Comprehensive**: Covers experiment tracking, model registry, and model serving
5. **Python Native**: Excellent integration with Python ML ecosystem
6. **Kubernetes Ready**: Designed to work well in containerized environments

### Why Not Other Tools?

- **Weights & Biables**: Proprietary, cloud-only, potential vendor lock-in
- **Neptune**: Proprietary, limited free tier, external dependency
- **DVC**: Data versioning focus, not comprehensive ML lifecycle management
- **ZenML**: Overly complex for this use case, potential learning curve
- **Airflow/Prefect/Argo**: Workflow orchestration focus, not ML-specific
- **Hydra**: Configuration management only, doesn't solve ML tracking needs

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single tool for tracking and registry
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer external services to manage
3. **Local Development**: Can run completely offline
4. **Cost Effective**: No per-user or per-run costs
5. **Full Control**: Complete ownership of data and infrastructure
6. **Kubernetes Integration**: Native support for containerized deployments

### Negative Consequences

1. **Limited Advanced Features**: May lack some advanced visualization features
2. **Self-Management**: Need to handle scaling, backups, and monitoring
3. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn MLflow-specific concepts
4. **Integration Effort**: May need custom integrations for some tools

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **MLflow Tracking Server**: Central experiment tracking
2. **MLflow Model Registry**: Model versioning and lifecycle management
3. **MLflow Artifact Store**: File storage for models and artifacts
4. **Custom CLI**: Typer-based orchestration layer
5. **FastAPI Serving**: Model serving with Prometheus metrics

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **ML Framework**: scikit-learn + PyTorch (for deep learning)
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Optuna
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality**: Ruff, Black, MyPy
- **Testing**: Pytest
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics

### Architecture Principles

1. **Configuration First**: All settings in YAML configs
2. **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout
3. **Reproducibility**: Deterministic seeds and versioning
4. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
6. **Documentation**: Inline and external documentation

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Multi-Tool Approach
- **Pros**: Best tool for each job, advanced features
- **Cons**: Complexity, integration challenges, vendor lock-in
- **Decision**: Rejected due to complexity and maintenance overhead

### Alternative 2: Cloud-Native Stack
- **Pros**: Managed services, scalability, advanced features
- **Cons**: Cost, vendor lock-in, external dependencies
- **Decision**: Rejected due to cost and vendor lock-in concerns

### Alternative 3: Minimal Tooling
- **Pros**: Simple, lightweight
- **Cons**: Limited functionality, manual processes
- **Decision**: Rejected due to insufficient ML lifecycle management

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- MLflow is mature and well-tested
- Open-source community support
- Local deployment capability

### Medium Risk
- Self-managed infrastructure scaling
- Custom integration development
- Team MLflow expertise

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Documentation and training
- Gradual rollout and monitoring

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: Complete ML pipeline from data to serving
2. **Performance**: Training and inference latency within acceptable bounds
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for serving endpoints
4. **Maintainability**: Code quality scores above 90%
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive coverage of all components

## Future Considerations

1. **Scaling**: Monitor MLflow performance as usage grows
2. **Integration**: Evaluate additional tools for specific needs
3. **Migration**: Plan for potential migration to cloud services if needed
4. **Community**: Contribute back to MLflow community
